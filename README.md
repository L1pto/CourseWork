Today there are many different programming paradigms, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. However, object-oriented programming (hereinafter "OOP") has become the main standard in software development nowadays. 
OOP - programming methodology based on the representation of the program in the form of a set of objects, each of which is an instance of a certain class, and the classes form a hierarchy of inheritance. This paradigm presents the developer with the ability to create very flexible applications that have a clear structure and the ability to quickly rework without affecting the entire application.
